## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are two ways React components can interact?
  Props: React components can interact by passing data through props (short for properties), allowing parent components to send information to child components.

State: React components can also interact through state, enabling components to manage and update their own data internally.

- How can multiple React components share state?
  Multiple React components can share state by lifting the state up to a common ancestor component and passing it down to the child components as props.
