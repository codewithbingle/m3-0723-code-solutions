## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do controlled components differ from uncontrolled components?
  Controlled components in React have their state managed by React, while uncontrolled components manage their own state, typically through the DOM.

- What are some advantages of using uncontrolled components?
  Uncontrolled components:

-Simplify code by avoiding state management.
-Allow instant field access without re-rendering.
-Align well with non-React code and third-party libraries.
-Provide more flexibility for user inputs and validation.

- What are some advantages of using controlled components?
  Controlled components:

-Enable direct control over form and field values.
-Facilitate complex functionality and interaction with real-time validation.
-Make it easier to collect, handle, and validate user input.
-Promote more predictable and deterministic behavior.

- Which style do you prefer?
  I like the uncontrolled one since it is simple to code.

- What two props must you pass to an input for it to be "controlled"?
  value: to set the current value of the input.
  onChange: to handle changes to the input value.

- What are some popular npm packages for creating forms in React?
  Redux-Form
  React Hook Form
